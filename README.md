Hello! 
Welcome to Stephanie's Cozy Tracker.
It is June 2025. I have been struggling to save this year. I've been trying google sheets as far as documents. 
I've tried my cellphone, and I've tried journals/calendars. Nothing worked.
I had this idea that if I could make it look pretty, fun, and interactive - 
I'd be able to stick with it. 
I figured, it would be funny to watch.
That's when it hit me that I wanted something similar to the Domino's pizza tracker, but girly.
something that fit my asethetic. 
ALAS, we made this tracker.
I have no background in coding. I have no idea what I'm doing, but we're here. 
This makes me feel like I'm back in my Tumblr and MySpace days.
I absolutely have loved every second of making this. 
I hope if you use this my user friendly version;
(whenever that comes out)
you enjoy it just as much as I do. 
Thanks for reading my journey.
Thanks for checking out my website. 
-Stephanie
